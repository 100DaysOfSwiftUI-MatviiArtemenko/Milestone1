> *You have a basic understanding of arrays, state, views, images, text, and more, so let’s put them together: your challenge is to make a brain training game that challenges players to win or lose at rock, paper, scissors.</br>*
> So, very roughly:
> + Each turn of the game the app will randomly pick either rock, paper, or scissors.
> + Each turn the app will alternate between prompting the player to win or lose.
> + The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game.
> + If they are correct they score a point; otherwise they lose a point.
> + The game ends after 10 questions, at which point their score is shown.
